    <p>Cooking Procedure for KARE-KARE...</p>
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Instructions:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large pot, boil the oxtail and tripe in water for about 1-2 hours until tender. Make sure to remove any scum that rises to the surface during the boiling process. You can also use a pressure cooker to significantly reduce the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Saut√© the garlic and onions in the annatto-infused oil until the onions become translucent.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add the annatto seeds and allow them to infuse the oil until it turns red. Remove the seeds and discard them. This will give your Kare-Kare a distinctive orange color.</li>
        <li>Add the ground roasted peanuts and flour to the pan. Stir continuously to avoid lumps..</li>
        <li>Gradually add the reserved meat stock while stirring constantly. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer until the sauce thickens. If it becomes too thick, you can add more water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Add the oxtail and tripe back to the pot with the thickened sauce and simmer for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggplant, string beans, and banana flower to the pot. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, add the pechay to the pot and cook for a few minutes until it wilts.
