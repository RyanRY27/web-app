    <p>Cooking Procedure for Adobo...</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Instructions:</span> This is just one variation of adobo</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, soy sauce, minced garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large, deep skillet or pot, heat a small amount of cooking oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook until the chicken turns brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vinegar and allow it to simmer for a few minutes, allowing the strong vinegar smell to dissipate.</li>
        <li>Add water to the skillet until it covers the chicken. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is tender. You can cover the skillet with a lid while simmering.</li>
        <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the flavor by adding more soy sauce or vinegar according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Continue to simmer until the sauce thickens and the chicken is fully cooked. You can also add a bit of sugar to balance the flavors, if desired.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Serve the Chicken Adobo hot with steamed rice. You can garnish it with some chopped green onions for added flavor and presentation.
